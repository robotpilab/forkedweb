We propose an anytime algorithm to plan the placement of a rigid object with a dual-arm robot in a cluttered environment. The algorithm integrates sampling-based motion planning with a novel hierarchical search for suitable placement poses, incrementally producing approach motions to stable placement poses and reaching placements with better objectives as runtime progresses. Our approach is effective for two different placement objectives, even in challenging scenarios.
